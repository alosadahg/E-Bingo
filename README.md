# How to play E-Bingo
### Enter game code
The game master should give the players the game code. If you are the game master, you can create a new bingo game or use the existing game code here [E-Bingo Game Master Dashboard](http://www.hyeumine.com/bingodashboard.php?bcode=ksFWEKc8).
### Generate play cards
Once the player has entered the game, they can now generate their play cards.
### Check win
Every time the check win button is clicked, the rolled numbers from the game master dashboard will be loaded to the player's side and a message will appear if the card has won.
